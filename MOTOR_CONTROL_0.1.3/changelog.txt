CHANGELOG MATLAB INTERFACE=== 0.0.8 ===- added capability to read data from 0x51 type	- Uses floating point values- implemented a command received feature so Matlab can confirmed buttons were pressed- Fixed a problem where I changed the command to set the runmode on Arduino and didn't update the commands in the GUI- Added the 0x51 data type to save packet- Implemented a Mode box so the user can track the mode on the Arduino- Removed alteration of time in the data, and instead only subtract t_0 at data plotting	- User must now determine t=0 fire time on first data packet where MODE = 2- Set data period and update period to 0.1 seconds	- Note that packets are dropped every now and then=== 0.0.9 ===- Changed output to display points instead of lines to avoid skipped packet mess- Added legends and grid to output graphs=== 0.1.0 ===- Added capability for packet 0x52- Removed capability for packet 0x50- Added capability to display 3rd thermocouple data- Switched Oxidizer display to be over the combustion display on gui- Changed several things in "update_plots.m" to account for changes in the way data is saved in MATLAB=== 0.1.0 ===- Fixed a bug where I forgot to update teh plots with 3 temperatures- Fixed data saving but where it labeled a temperature as pre-combustion to post-combustion temperature=== 0.1.1 ===- Fixed an issue where I forgot to code for tpc, causing the program to crash on attempting to plot=== 0.1.2 ===- Johnny's test version=== 0.1.3 ===- Fixed an issue that caused plots to be 0 a lot- Fixed a bug in "update_plots.m" where dropped packets are displayed as 0 values in text in gui	- TODO: Fix the bug where the dropped packet is saved		- This bug is not caused by dropped packets, upon closer analysis of saved data. Fix indexing issue- Added call to "update_input_buffer()" while plotting in case it takes too much timeTODO (before wednesday):- Create new Arduino output for errors (specifically the safety factor failed)    - Detect by Arduino    - Let Matlab tell us that the arduino has detected a motor error
